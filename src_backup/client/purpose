Game DLL (game.dll / server.dll)
The main DLL responsible for game logic and entity behavior.

Contains code for:

Static props (e.g. prop_static)

Dynamic props (e.g. prop_dynamic)

Physics props (e.g. prop_physics, prop_ragdoll)

NPCs, weapons, and gameplay rules.

On a dedicated server, the equivalent is server.dll — which runs without rendering.

On the client, the equivalent is client.dll — handling client-side rendering, prediction, and UI.
