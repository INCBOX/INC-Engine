# INC Engine

INC Engine is a modular, C++ game engine inspired by Valve's Source Engine architecture. It features:

- Dynamic filesystem loading using `gameinfo.txt` and Source-style `searchpaths`
- Modular runtime DLL structure (`engine.dll`, `client.dll`, etc.)
- Custom ShaderAPI abstraction supporting OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX backends
- Modern OpenGL rendering with VAOs/VBOs and MVP matrix math
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS planned)

INC Engine is built from the ground up with a clean, maintainable structure for serious engine development and experimentation.
