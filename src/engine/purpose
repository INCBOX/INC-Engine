2. Engine DLL (engine.dll)
The core engine, handles rendering, input, network, physics integration with middleware (e.g., Havok in older Source versions), file I/O, and general engine-level services.

Does not implement game-specific entity logic or props directly.

Communicates with the game DLL to spawn and simulate entities.
